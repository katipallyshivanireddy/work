<p>Mani Ratnam after his long relationship with Ilaiyaraaja, parted ways and introduced newcomer A. R. Rahman in Roja. He happened to listen and was impressed with Rahman's works, Ratnam visited his studio and listened to a tune that Rahman had composed long back on the Kaveri River water dispute. Ratnam signed him immediately for the film, which was the first one in his terrorism trilogy. Rahman, in spite of his reluctance to seriously take up work in films, accepted the offer since Ratnam had the reputation of a director with a good taste for music.</p>
